# Readme
401 is an Intermediate Programming course centered in Java where we learned Object Oriented Programming, taught by https://github.com/PatHealy when I took it. 
All of the labs and assignments were completed by me, with Assignment 4 having example code to build from and some later labs (past 10) I sometimes was given code to start with.
